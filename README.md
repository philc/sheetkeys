## SheetKeys - The Hacker's Spreadsheet

Sheetkeys is a Chrome extension which adds powerful keyboard navigation shortcuts to Google Sheets, in the
spirit of the Vim text editor. It's written by one of the authors of
[Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium).

(If you are using SheetKeys with [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium), disable Vimium on Google Sheets so
its key mappings don't collide with SheetKeys. To do so, click on the Vimium icon in Chrome's toolbar, enter
`https?://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/*` for the excluded sites Pattern, and click Save.)

## How to install

Install on the Chrome web store (coming soon).

To install from source, see [here](https://github.com/philc/sheetkeys/wiki/How-to-install-from-source).

## Keyboard Mappings

SheetKeys adds many key mappings to Google Sheets. After installing, you can see and customize all of them by
typing `?` while on a Google Sheets page.

## Other improvements to Google Sheets

* In Google Sheets, when editing a cell, typing ESC erases all of the changes you've made, and your changes
  can't be brought back with "Undo". Sheetkeys fixes this. Now ESC will save your changes to the cell, and you
  can revert them by using Undo.
* `Ctrl-e` on Mac OS X is a handy system-wide shortcut which moves the cursor to the end of the form field
  you're currently editing. This essential shortcut doesn't work in Google Sheets. With Sheetkeys, it does.

## Developer workflow

* You can use the
  [Extension Reloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-reloader/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid)
  which provides a quick shortcut for reloading all of your locally-developed extensions. See
  [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12767200/46237) for further info.
* Refresh your Google Sheets page after reloading the Sheetkeys extension in Chrome.
